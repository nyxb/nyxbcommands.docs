# Customizable channel specific commands

Server owners using your bot can set some commands to only be ran in specific channels within their server. They can do this with the following:

`/channelCommand <Command Name> [channel tag]`

If a user attempts to use a command in the wrong channel then they will be told what channels they are allowed to use.
