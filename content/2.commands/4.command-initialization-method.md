# Command initialization method

Some commands may require you to run code when they are loaded. You can use the `init()` method within your command to handle this type of functionality:

::code-group
  ```ts [typescript]
  import { Client } from 'discord.js'
  import NYXBCommands, { CommandObject, CommandType } from '@nyxb/commands'
  
  export default {
    description: 'Ping pong command',
    type: CommandType.BOTH,

    init: (client: Client, instance: NYXBCommands) => {
      console.log('Ping command has been loaded')
    },

    callback: () => {
      return {
        content: 'Pong!',
      }
    },
} as CommandObject
  ```
  ```js [javascript]
  const { CommandType } = require('@nyxb/commands')
  
  module.exports = {
    description: 'Ping pong command',
    type: CommandType.BOTH,

    init: (client, instance) => {
      console.log('Ping command has been loaded')
    },

    callback: () => {
      return {
        content: 'Pong!',
      }
    },
}
  ```
