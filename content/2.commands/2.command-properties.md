# Command properties

This page assumes you have a basic bot running using NYXBCommands as seen [here](https://nyxcommands.nyxb.nexus/commands/ping-pong).

::callout{type="primary" icon}
A command's file name will become the executable name of the command. Additional aliases can be set.

:br
::callout{type="danger" icon}
This code is designed for demonstration purposes only. Copy/pasting this will lead to errors.

## Object properties

All commands are exported as objects who have properties to dictate the command's functionality. Here is a complete list of all current properties available to you:
